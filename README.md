## 1. Description

If you are using PhoneGap Build and want landscape and portrait enabled on iPad, but only portrait on iPhone/iPod, then you've come to the right place.
Add this plugin and set orientation to portrait, this plugin will add landscape orientation for iPad only.

## 2. Installation

The only thing you need to do is editing your `www/config.xml`.
Add this line:

```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.ipadlandscapeenabler" />
```
or to use this exact version:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.ipadlandscapeenabler" version="3.0" />
```

And while you are editing the `www/config.xml`, make sure you set the orientation preference to portrait:
```xml
<preference name="orientation" value="portrait" />
```

This makes sure all devices will have portrait mode only, but for iPad landscape is added by this plugin.
